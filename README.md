# Purpose
This project introduces a 3D model retrieval method using airborne LiDAR point clouds as input queries, which
encodes 3D models and point clouds based on roof geometry of building. A database containing 1 million
3D models collected from Internet is built for evaluation. Web-based retrieval system is implemented and
available. (http://pcretrieval.dgl.xyz)
